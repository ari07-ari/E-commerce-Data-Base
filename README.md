## Installation
I made a repository in GitHub, which then cloned it into my terminal and folder. Afterwards, I created files and installed packages to help me run future code.

## Usage
The purpose of this program is to allow users have an easier manipulation of data. It helps with time consumption and displays an organized setup for anyone to understand.
